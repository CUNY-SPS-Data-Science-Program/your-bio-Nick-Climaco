Hello all,

My name is Nick Climaco. 

You can contact me through email: nick.climaco15@spsmail.cuny.edu

I am currently a full time student in this MSDS program. I am comfortable using Python and R.

I have no working knowledge of Geograhic Information Systems yet.

In the short term, I plan on finishing and earning this MS degree in Data Science  then pursue a position in a data job (data analyst/data scientist/data engineer). Moreover, I am also interested in exploring opportunities in finance as a quant analyst.

From this course, my goal is to acquire the skills necessary to create complex data visualizations that effectively communicate information without the need for extensive explanation.
